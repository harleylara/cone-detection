# Yolov7 Checkpoints

## Download Pre-trained Weights

To use Pre-trained weight we recommend to pull the original weight from [yolov7 repo](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/main).

As example you can pull the `yolov7x` variant with the following command:

```
wget https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7x_training.pt
```
